# Action-Sequence-and-Motion-Recognition
## Description
### Main Idea
Many sports enthusiasts, from novice photographers to professional publications, rely on
manual image segmentation with tools like Photoshop to combine multiple images of a bike 
trick or basketball dunk into a single image by cutting out the foreground of each image and 
overlaying it onto the background of one image.
Assume a fixed camera that shoots a short video of some motion. A first step is determining a 
number of key frames (burst shots) that mainly construct the motion sequence. The goal of this 
project is to develop an algorithm that can automatically combine multiple images generated 
from burst shots of an action into a single image that clearly shows the full action, as shown in
Figure 1. It also recognizes the moving object motion (walk, wave, bend, etc.).
